# D3.js Visualizations

## How to use
To take a look at our website, and the visualization that we have implemented so far, you can 
unzip the zip file. Now you can open the folder using an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Webstorm.
If you are using Visual Studio Code, make sure the "Live Server" extension is downloaded. 
From here, you can open the index.html file on local host with a browser. This can be run on local host and this is our main website. 
From there you may click the 'visualization 1' button on the nagivation bar to the left. Then you can select
"All data" to take a look at our Hierarchical edge bundling visualization and hover over specific emails
to see how it reacts. 

## Feature Explanation
The hierarchical edge bundling visualization has been implemented after reading in the dataset. 
You may hover over any specific email to see the emails of all the person that the employee has sent an email to. 
The highlighted email is made bold and the links are colored with a shade of blue.
